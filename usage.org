This file contains the current targeted usage.

* Basic usage overview

Start the daemon with either one of:

- `$ mumd` for debugging
- `$ mumd &|` (disowning)
- `$ mumd --daemon`
- systemd-service
- Run in a `screen`/`tmux`/...
- Other ways of keeping a binary running

The daemon doesn't do anything by itself. Interface using `mumctl`.
