This file contains the current targeted usage. It works as both a design document
and a feature tracker. New commands and flags go here.

* Basic usage overview

Start the daemon with either one of:

- `$ mumd`. Writes to stdout, ignores stdin. Can easily be disowned/started in
  a screen/tmux.

We want to support / explain how to do the following at some point:

- `$ mumd --daemon`
- systemd-service

The daemon doesn't do anything by itself. Interfacing with it is done through
`mumctl`.
